# Personal-Pojects
Some personal projects to practice my Python skills

risk.py is a simulation dice roller that follows the attack rules of the board game Risk. An attacker picks a number attacking units and how many units they are willing to lose, and a Defender picks how many units they are attacking with. The simulation ends when the attacker or defender loses all their units

main.py is a discord bot that generates works. The bot will pick out workout type, number of sets and number of reps depending on the difficulty chosen.
